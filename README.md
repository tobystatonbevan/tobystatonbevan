Hello. I’m @tobystatonbevan. I am a cyber assurance analyst and cyber security academic, with an interest in risk assessment and security testing. I work mostly in Python for data analysis, however I am looking to develop educational tools in Python for students to learn and test cyber security practices. 

I also include any side projects and experiments that reach a suitable level of completion to my GitHub, including attempts at building retro games or helpful scripts to complete basic tasks!
